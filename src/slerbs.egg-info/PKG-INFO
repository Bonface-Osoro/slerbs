# Systematic Literature Review for Broadband Sustainability (slerbs)
This is a repository for quantifying the amount of scientific articles focusing 
on the role of broadband in supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

Few studies have fully investigated the link between universal broadband access, 
SDGs and environmental sustainability. Understandably, most broadband research 
focuses on the cost and technical solutions for providing last mile connectivity. 
However, there is need to underscore the importance of broadband in realizing SDGs. 
Documenting and highlighting the role of broadband in realization of the SDGs 
increases the likelihood of policy makers and analysts in prioritizing and 
deploying broadband. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to provide a survey 
and review the research that demonstrate the importance of broadband in 
supporting SDGs and environmental sustainability. Specifically, the research 
questions are:

1.	What are the major SDGs linked to broadband connectivity?
2.	Which development areas have benefited from broadband connectivity?
3.	What are the dominant techniques and scopes of broadband connectivity, SDG 
    and environmental sustainability studies?

 `Figure 1` shows the outline of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
 Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) followed in the literature.
