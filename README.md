# Systematic Literature Review for Broadband Sustainability (slerbs) 

Several developing economies are yet to meet the targets of the SDGs, especially 
the Low-Income Countries (LICs). On the other hand, Upper Middle-Income Countries 
(UMCs) and High-Income Countries (HICs) have made significant steps in addressing 
SDGs with key milestones in broadband deployment. Surprisingly, few studies have 
fully investigated the link between universal broadband access, SDGs and environmental 
sustainability for different economies. Understandably, most broadband research focuses 
on the cost and technical solutions for providing last mile connectivity. However, there 
is need to underscore the importance of broadband in realizing SDGs. Documenting and 
highlighting the role of broadband in realization of the SDGs increases the likelihood 
of policy makers and analysts in prioritizing and deploying broadband. Therefore, the 
goal of this paper is to provide a survey and review the research that demonstrate the 
importance of broadband in supporting SDGs and environmental sustainability. 
Specifically, the research questions are:

1.	What are the major SDGs linked to broadband connectivity?
2.	What are the key broadband technologies for different target areas?
3.	What are the main challenges and future directions on broadband sustainability research?

## Literature Review Results
In `Figure 2` the spatial distribution of the location of authors. The number 
of papers published is shown globally as well as for USA and China where the highest 
number of research on relationship between broadband and SDGs was recorded.
